# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

This project is an **end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline** built on the famous Titanic dataset. The pipeline covers all essential ML stages — from **data collection** to **model evaluation** — implemented in **Jupyter Notebook** for better prediction and accuracy.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The objective is to predict passenger survival on the Titanic disaster using features such as age, gender, ticket class, etc.

The pipeline includes:

1. **Data Collection** – Load Titanic dataset (`titanic.csv`) from GitHub.
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Handle missing values, duplicates, and categorical encoding.
3. **Feature Engineering** – Create new features (e.g., Title extraction, Family size).
4. **Model Training** – Train models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.
5. **Model Evaluation** – Compare models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
